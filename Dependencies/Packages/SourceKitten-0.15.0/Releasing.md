# Releasing SourceKitten

For SourceKitten contributors, follow these steps to cut a release:

1. Update version number in the following files:
    * `Source/sourcekitten/Info.plist`
    * `Source/SourceKittenFramework/Info.plist`
    * `Source/sourcekitten/VersionCommand.swift`
    * `SourceKitten.podspec`
2. Come up with a witty feline themed release name. Past names include:
    * Objective-Cat
    * Cat-astrophic
    * SourceClangKitLibKitten
    * Grumpy Cat
3. Update the first header in `CHANGELOG.md` to the new version number & release
   name.
4. Commit & push to the `master` branch.
5. Tag: `git tag -a 0.6.2 -m "0.6.2: Objective-Cat"; git push origin 0.6.2`
6. Make sure you have the latest stable Xcode version installed or symlinked
   under `/Applications/Xcode.app` and `xcode-select`ed.
7. Create the pkg installer & framework zip: `make release`
8. Create a GitHub release: https://github.com/realm/SourceKitten/releases/new
    * Specify the tag you just pushed from the dropdown.
    * Set the release title to the new version number & release name.
    * Add the changelog section to the release description text box.
    * Upload the pkg installer and Carthage zip
      (`SourceKittenFramework.framework.zip`) you just built to the GitHub
      release binaries.
    * Click "Publish release"
9. File a PR towards Homebrew bumping the `tag`, `revision` & Xcode version
   dependency if necessary.
   See [homebrew#45651](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/45651) as an
   example.
10. Push to CocoaPods trunk: `pod trunk push`
